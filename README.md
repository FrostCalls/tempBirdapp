# Bird-Spotter-App
COMP08068: Programming for Mobile Devices - Android Projecy

Tasks to complete:

1a. Horizontal scrolling recycler view
[either this, or the search bar] To be added to the AddActivity page. This should replace the field to enter the name of the bird.
Having a bird selected and then clicking submit, submits the name of that bird to the database. Selecting a little 'i' button
should open a popup (see fragments that may help) showing a bit of info copy pasted from wiki.

1.b Search bar
I had a look at this one, and it looks like no easy task. I think someone should choose between this and the
horizontal recycler view, having both might be too much.

2. Validation & Exception handling
Validation and error handling for all user input. All inputs for database are string, ensure data that comes in looks clean
complies to a common sense format. Toast messages should be put in to tell the user if something is wrong, but adding specific
warnings may make the task to large, perhaps just have a 'Password does not meet requirements', but could be expanded to
add a requirements popup, or show how it didnt meet requirements. Ensure blanks cant be added.

3. Cosmetic updates
I just did enough visual elements to make it so i could enter data and test the app. The whole look needs to change. This won't require
more than the first couple of lectures/fundamental courses to complete.

Additional:

I'm not in for the next lecture. Can someone put the lates version on their phone and show the lecturer?
